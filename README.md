# Problem Statement

## Task Name : 
Development of a Customizable, Draggable To-Do List Application in React

## Description : 
To develop an interactive, draggable to-do list application using React that addresses the need for a dynamic and customizable task management tool. The application will feature four main boards: "To Do," "Doing," "Done," and a custom board that users can create and name based on their specific needs. This solution aims to enhance user engagement and productivity by allowing for a more flexible, visual approach to task management.


## Key Features:
Draggable Task Entries: Users should be able to create tasks and drag them between boards to reflect their current status, providing a seamless workflow transition from "To Do" to "Done."

## Custom Board Creation:
 Beyond the predefined boards, users should have the ability to create one or more custom boards. This feature allows for personalized task categorization, catering to diverse project needs or personal preferences.

## Interactive User Interface: 
The application should offer an intuitive, easy-to-navigate interface that supports drag-and-drop functionality, enabling users to manage tasks efficiently without extensive training.

## Responsive Design: 
The application must be responsive, ensuring a consistent and accessible user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

##
Data Persistence:
 Implement a solution for data persistence, ensuring that user-created tasks and custom board configurations are saved and remain intact across application sessions.

## Expected Outcome:
The successful implementation of this application will provide users with a versatile tool for managing tasks, allowing for better organization, increased productivity, and customization to suit individual workflow preferences. By offering an intuitive, interactive platform for task management, the application aims to address the limitations of traditional to-do lists, thereby meeting the evolving needs of users in various contexts, from personal project management to team-based workflows.
